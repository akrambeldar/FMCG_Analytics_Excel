# FMCG_Analytics_Excel
The FMCG project developed in Excel is an interactive dashboard that has Quantity Analysis, Profit Analysis, Sales  Analysis and Order-wise Analysis.

# OBJECTIVE 
The focus of the "Data Analytics Project for FMCG" was to comprehend the FMCG sector and analyse FMCG retail data using sophisticated Excel algorithms. To begin with, I researched the FMCG sector and made an effort to learn more about it both internationally and in India.

# METHODOLOGY
A sample dataset on FMCG retail data was obtained, which was divided into two sheets. The FMCG retail data sheet included 47041 rows and 9 columns, while the mapping sheet had 57 rows and 3 columns. I computed and added a few rows to the FMCG retail data, such as margin, profit, year, month, and quarter, using the information from the mapping sheet. I used the following excel functions: 'index-match', 'product', 'year', 'month', and if condition.
I first learned about certain business-related issues before creating the dashboards for the study. The four categories were Quantity Analysis, Profit Analysis, Sales Analysis, and Order-wise Analysis. To obtain more exact insights, year and region-specific slicers were introduced and connected to each dashboard.
